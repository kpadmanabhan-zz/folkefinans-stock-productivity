# folkefinans-stock-productivity
Programming test for Folkefinans.

Notes:
~~~~~~
1. As the programming_test.pdf mentioned specific usage of web forms / web api, choice was made as web api in web forms. 
This is quite handy in web forms projects that need to make use of server api to perform certain tasks.

2. Styling is not taken into consideration. Used the ASP.NET web forms basic skeleton. Functionalities implemente using basic asp tables and textboxes

3. In "View Calculated Result" page, detailed resuls table is populated using postback call. This could have alternatively been handled using ajax and jquery. 
However, as these were not explicitly mentioned, relied on implementation using server postback.
